Status:

part1: Works on all tests.
part2: Works on all tests.
part3: Works on all tests.
part4: Works on all tests.
part5: Works on all tests.

Overall: All tests worked. There were differences in the files because the ordering of my prolog program output was different in the unsorted cases. I made use of part 3's cmember function in part 4 and part 5.
